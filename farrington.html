Territory of Hawaiʻi, who served from 1921 to 1929.
During the World War II, the U.S. Army used the school as a hospital.
Farrington is an urban high school that serves an ethnically diverse community of mostly lower socio-economic families and a smaller number of middle-class families.

Farrington provides career pathways for its students through several programs, including a health academy that was nationally recognized for excellence. In addition, Farrington offers students 
opportunities to participate and excel in both visual and performing arts.

<p style="color:maroon;"> Homecoming is a week of activities were we students show our class spirit. The main event of the homecoming week is our football game. All the past graduates of Farrington High School come to game and show there governor
spirits. What we do in the week of homecoming game? On day one we do a banner parade of all the class and the clubs in the school. On the second day we have class color and song contest between each class. Class color we wear our color and then during 
lunch we sign in our name. The most class that has a lot amount of student signing up wins. Song contest we just pick a song and we sing it to the judge. On the third day we have power puff and pep squad. On this day the boys are the cheer leaders, and the
